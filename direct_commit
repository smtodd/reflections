What happens when I create a file directly in a github repository?

What happens when I create a branch on Github then do a pull?
	A pull from a remote branch includes the merge function.  So it both fetches (brings them over) and merges them.  So I still only had one branch.  To get updates, it could be good, but not in this case.
I did a [git checkout --track origin/branch_2] command.
	This created the branch in my local repository.  I am not sure how exactly the tracking works.
What happens when I update the branch_2 locally?
	Lines 4-7 were added on my local computer.  This line is added on Github.  The track command seems to link this branch
	with my local branch_2. The local updates automatically updated to this branch without changing the master branch. Which
	is what I was tryng to do.
