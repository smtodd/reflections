What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing a repository adds a .git folder to the folder (directory) you are in.
	If you want to start a new git repository, it's what you do.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a temporary holding area for items that are going into the git repository.  It offers the option to select only some of the files to go into the repository.  It also offers a final chance to double check which files you want to put in.
Will it work this time?
