What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing a repository adds a .git folder to the folder (directory) you are in.
	If you want to start a new git repository, it's what you do.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a temporary holding area for items that are going into the git repository.  It offers the option to select only some of the files to go into the repository.  It also offers a final chance to double check which files you want to put in.
Why did my commits not work for a while?
	I had somehow changed the local core.editor in this repository to --help. It must be from one of the mistakes I made when I was playing around figuring out how to set and use the core.editor.  I was trying to see if I could make some changes so that only one sublime file would open when I used git commit.  One of the things I tried must have messed up the local core.editor
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized.  How would branches help.
	Branches could be used if you had different devs working on different features of a project at the same time.  Each dev could have a branch with their name. It could also be helpful if you were adding multiple features at once.  Or if you had a branch to work on a new feature and a master branch that clients were using where updates would only be bug fixes.
